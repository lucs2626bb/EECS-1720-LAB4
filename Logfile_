Jan 19 (Day 2)
I apolegize if I have barely did anything within the last several days :(
However I did manage to expirement more with p5js to see what I could do with my first lab assignment

Updates to sketch.js:
-Learned how to use buttons and sliders for the first time (I'm familiar to most of the stuff I did in processing and java)
  -Sliderbars that affect the speed, colour, and size of the ball
  -Button that resets the position of the ball (still in progress)
  -functions (im assuming they replace libraries)
-Managed to get the web extension examples working from the lecture (for some reason I couldn't get it to work in firefox in the lab)

I tired yet agian to learn javascript
I did 1 easy challenge: https://edabit.com/challenge/nhXofMMyrowMyr9Nv

-Its supposed to generate the maximum edge for a triangle, but I made it into a simple triangle generator
